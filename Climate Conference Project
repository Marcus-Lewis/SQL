For this project, you are helping to organize a conference for climate research, which will have hundreds of attendees.
Your job has been to manage the 30 conference VIPs, who are all members of this organization. 
Database: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/pxMci1sLL945KHKYvpe9W6/1

1. List all VIP members along with their event information (Left Join)
SELECT v.member_id, v.first_name, v.last_name, e.event_name, e.event_type
FROM vips v
LEFT JOIN events e ON v.event = e.event_id;
*This query uses a LEFT JOIN to show all VIP members, including those who aren't attending any event (where event is NULL).

2. Show members attending panel events and their hotel reservations (Inner Join)
SELECT v.member_id, v.first_name, v.last_name, e.event_name, h.hotel_name, r.welcome_rsvp, r.dinner_rsvp
FROM vips v
INNER JOIN events e ON v.event = e.event_id
INNER JOIN reservations r ON v.member_id = r.member_id
INNER JOIN hotels h ON r.hotel = h.hotel_id
WHERE e.event_type = 'Panel';
*This INNER JOIN query only returns members who are attending panel events and have made hotel reservations.

3. Find all feedback relationships between members (Self Join)
SELECT v1.member_id AS provider_id, 
       v1.first_name || ' ' || v1.last_name AS provider_name,
       v2.member_id AS receiver_id,
       v2.first_name || ' ' || v2.last_name AS receiver_name
FROM vips v1
JOIN vips v2 ON v1.member_id = v2.provides_feedback_to;
*This SELF JOIN query shows who provides feedback to whom in the organization.

4. Count reservations by hotel with subquery (Subquery)
SELECT h.hotel_name, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reservations r WHERE r.hotel = h.hotel_id) AS total_reservations,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reservations r WHERE r.hotel = h.hotel_id AND r.welcome_rsvp = 1) AS welcome_attendees,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reservations r WHERE r.hotel = h.hotel_id AND r.dinner_rsvp = 1) AS dinner_attendees
FROM hotels h;
*This query uses subqueries to count total reservations and attendance for each hotel.

5. Find members from educational institutions attending workshops (Multiple Joins)
SELECT v.member_id, v.first_name, v.last_name, v.association, e.event_name
FROM vips v
JOIN events e ON v.event = e.event_id
JOIN reservations r ON v.member_id = r.member_id
WHERE v.assoc_type = 'education' AND e.event_type = 'Workshop';
*This query uses multiple joins to find educational institution members attending workshop events

6. List members who haven't RSVP'd for dinner but are staying at the Hyatt Downtown
SELECT v.member_id, v.first_name, v.last_name, h.hotel_name
FROM vips v
JOIN reservations r ON v.member_id = r.member_id
JOIN hotels h ON r.hotel = h.hotel_id
WHERE r.dinner_rsvp = 0 AND h.hotel_name = 'Hyatt Downtown';
*This query identifies members who haven't signed up for dinner but are staying at a specific hotel.
